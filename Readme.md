# Solar System Simulation

A Computer Graphics project simulating the Solar System using OpenGL.  
Built as part of an academic project to visualize the planetary orbits, rotation, and scaling with real-time rendering.

---

## Features

- Real-time simulation of the Sun and planets
- Scaled revolution and rotation speeds (not to actual scale for better visualization)
- Hierarchical modeling for orbits
- Planetary textures
- Zoom and camera controls
- Pause/Play simulation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C/C++
- **Graphics Library:** OpenGL (GLUT/GLFW)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks / Dev C++
